<a href="https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/tree/master/StuffContainer/testScripts/testRobot/testRun.sikuli" target="_blank">see a test script combining RFW with Sikulix and Selenium</a><br>
fixed: NPE when setting autoWaitTimeout of a region to 0 
<h4>Build: 2015-07-03</h4>
added: a showcase (runnable from the net) for the usage of Selenium Firefox in SikuliX script (tested on Mac and Windows)<br>
added: download and store available extensions using setup (from commandline: setup...jar options extensions)<br>

fixed: Mac OSX 10.11: SikuliX.app did not start up
<h4>Build: 2015-06-30</h4>

revised: feature load(jar): more options to find the jar, imagepath to folder in jar can be given<br>
added: buildJarFromFolder(): to build a jar on the fly at runtime<br>
added: compileJythonFolder(): replaces the contained .py files with it's compiled versions ...$py.class
(can be used for source protection)<br>
fixed: App class: LinuxUtil: added a stub implementation for getApp() to avoid loss of pid
<h4>Build: 2015-06-25</h4>
added: Jython scripts: highlightOff() switches off all current highlights
<h4>Build: 2015-06-24</h4>
revised: RunServer: now works according to http://sikulix.com/support<br>
fixed: Finder: Windows: now works again<br>
fixed: App class: isRunning() now works on Windows and Mac<br>
added: Jython support: now Lib/site-packages is recognized
and can have a sites.txt containing more paths (see docs/Using Python)
<h4>Build: 2015-06-22</h4>
revised: commandfiles on Mac to have alternatives to start the IDE (shows SikuliX icon in taskbar and SikuliX as name)<br>
revised: App class on Mac, still App.open() (app not running)
does not work on 10.9 and earlier (on 10.10 with most apps works),
when the script is run from the IDE that is running as SikuliX.app
- when starting the IDE or running script from commandline it works<br>
<h4>Build: 2015-06-15</h4>
fixed: Windows: Jython scripting: exceptions in imported stuff now again shown correctly
<h4>Build: 2015-05-28</h4>
revised: findBest(): now internally works on the given images in parallel (threading)

top left to bottom right either row-wise or column-wise<br>
added: findBest(): find the match with the highest score out of the list of given images<br>
revised: App.isRunning(): now internally refreshes the App instance,
so the App can be created with a window title and later be checked, whether it is running,
if other means are used to start the app (usage instead of "if someApp.window()")
<h4>Build: 2015-05-22</h4>
revised: class App: App.open() and openApp() now ignore already running instances of the named app and will in doubt start a new instance.
Windows: openApp("cmd.exe /c "some command to run") works again
<h4>Build: 2015-05-21</h4>
fixed: getBundlePath: Windows: now without leading slash<br>
revised App class (Windows): faster now and focus indeed activates the frontmost window

fixed: App.getWindow(): Mac: a problem with , in a title<br>
continued: RunServer and RunClient (now named Run)
<h4>Build: 2015-05-16</h4>
fixed: IDE: cursor keeps current position in cases, where the content is re-evaluated (toggle view and image rename)<br>
added: experimental (more options might follow):
a feature to highlight the search region before search (green frame)
and the match (if found, red frame) after the search (each for 2 seconds),
might be an alternative to slow motion running. Start: Debug.highlightOn(), Stop: Debug.highlightOff().
works for region.method() usage and for setROI() usage. The region/ROI must be at least 10 pixel smaller
than the screen on all sides, otherwise the green frame is omitted.
<h4>Build: 2015-05-15</h4>
fixed: multi monitor: should be fixed now (tested on Mac (incl. 10.10.x) and on Windows)<br>
revised: IDE: show button: now recognizes negative coordinates and finds image on all screens.<br>
added: class App: now possible to add parameters/options again as a string using setUsing(...). <br>
Currently only recognized on Windows, which brings back the possibility to <br>
open an application with parameters/options. <br>
Until now: App.open("some.exe parm1 parm2 ...") <br>
must now be written as App("some.exe").setUsing("parm1 parm2 ...").open()
<h4>Build: 2015-05-13</h4>
revised: class App: Mac/Windows: an app now knows it's process ID (PID) and its frontmost window title<br>
you can ask an app wether it is running and wether it has a window<br>
if an app is running it is not started again with open(). Linux: not yet revised
<h4>Build: 2015-05-08</h4>
revised: class App: App.open, focus, close on Windows to be more consistent.
getWindow() to get the title of the frontmost window of an app. The same app is only opened once -
a running process is reused.
<h4>Build: 2015-05-04</h4>
temp fix: IDE as mac app: added a hack to avoid click/type slowdown after about 60 seconds<br>
temp fixed: IDE: switching to Jython 2.7.0 final with setup option for Jython 2.5 (when unicode problems arise)
<h4>Build: 2015-05-01</h4>
added: IDE: buttons to capture a point and an offset and <br>
to show (highlight) the leftmost item in the line having the cursor (if possible in the line context)<br>
added: IDE: capturing with the cursor in a line containing only imagename = will result in an<br>
image filename as imagename.png and overwrites on recapture. (to support naming schemes and variable use)
<h4>Build: 2015-04-23</h4>
fixed: setup did not work anymore with already downloaded artefacts (offline setup)<br>
added: runScript(): inline run of PowerShell snippets
<h4>Build: 2015-04-20</h4>
added: runScript("applescript tell ..."): run code snippets in AppleScript on Mac using osascript<br>
fixed: possible problem with setup running with proxy<br>
revised: running Python scripts from net and with RunServer<br>
revised runsikulix.cmd: now first we check, whether java can be run from system path<br>
fixed: each SikuliX session should have it's own temp folder (auto deleted at JVM shutdown).
Still the IDE GUI can only run once, but as much as one likes in parallel from commandline.
<h4>Build: 2015-04-17</h4>
fixed: user args after -- not filled into sys.argv when running from commandline<br>
fixed: runsikulix.cmd did not use Java 8, if available in standard places<br>
fixed: tessdata not bundled when using setup with option 1 only<br>
fixed: exists(Pattern(image)) hangs (internally looping endlessly), if image file is not available<br>
added: experimental: RunServer: run scripts (or JavaScript snippets) from anywhere using a http RESTful protocol<br>
fixed: save script problems causing exceptions should be handled internally (otherwise might block GUI)<br>
added: experimental: visual annotation (former extension Guide) now a standard feature of SikuliX (contained in sikulixapi.jar)
<h4>Build: 2015-04-03</h4>
fixed: runScript(): possible NPE, when used in scripts run from commandline
<h4>Build: 2015-04-01</h4>
revised: jython script running with sikulixapi.jar::Runner: now returns the value from an exit(n)<br>
fixed: Linux: possible NPE in build on the fly
<h4>Build: 2015-03-31</h4>
added: jython script running with sikulixapi.jar::Runner: usage: org.sikuli.script.Runner.run(scriptPath, args),
sikulixapi.jar and a jython.jar must be on classpath (auto taken from setup downloads if omitted).
<h4>Build: 2015-03-27</h4>
fixed: Mac: a problem that made it to not run any longer with Java 6<br>
revised: MouseMovedCallback feature<br>
added: set callback handler and request visiting the handler before processing a mouse action (on/off)<br>
added: request termination with next mouse action throwing an AssertionError
<h4>Build: 2015-03-24</h4>
fixed: (I hope ;-) all regression bugs against 1.0.1 in multi monitor environments<br>
revised: ALL in Jython scripts and Screen.all().getRegion() can now be used, to search on all monitors in the same op
(ALL.click(someBotton) will find and click the button, no matter on which monitor it currently is)
<h4>Build: 2015-03-24</h4>
added: multi monitor: a visual can now be found on all screens with one op: Screen.all().getRegion().find(someImage)
will return a match, that knows it's screen, hence match.getScreen() will return the screen it was found on.
Take care: is a lengthy operation and costs some memory, so it should be used with care.
If the match spans screens, the screen with the biggest part is the winner (should be avoided).
<h4>Build: 2015-03-22</h4>
the next days I will somehow reveal more information about the new or revised features<br>
... but many features are already in the docs<br>
<br>
